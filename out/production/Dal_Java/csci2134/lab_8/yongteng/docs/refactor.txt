Refactorings:
=============

1. File: SpressoBot.java, ChickenBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): getNextMove(), line 41
   Issue Identified: Similar code to check if move will result in
                     energy use and decrement energyLevel if that
                     is the case, but the scale to the score is different
   Description of fix:  Push the common method into TimBot.java, creating a
                        public method to be used instead, the scale to
                        the score is different, so I added an instance
                        variable scale, and it has different data initialization
                        in Spresso and ChickenBot.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

2. File: TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): 15
   Issue Identified: Parent class TimBot.java does not implement an interface
   Description of fix: Added an interface called Movable that has an abstract
                       method getNextMove to define the behaviors in the parent
                       class.
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

3. File: BullyBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): 15
   Issue Identified: Subclass too similar with its super class
   Description of fix: Removed extra inheritance, only extend TimBot instead of ChickenBot
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)

4. File: AngryBot.java, TimBot.java
   Location (method/approx. line #): AngryBot 59, TimBot 136, 91
   Issue Identified: Common code inside a function can be extracted outside into a helper
                     method.
   Description of fix: Extracted in the super class TimBot as a method finMin()
   Implemented: Yes (Completely, all tests pass)
