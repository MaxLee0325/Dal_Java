==========

For each bug, please provide the following information:
  - Method name
  - Test method name
  - Message produced by the test method
  - Suggest a way that the bug revealed by the test can be fixed.
  - Any additional comments or analysis that the test revealed.

Example:
Error 0:
  Method: add()
  Test Method: test add()
  Message: add() did not return null when a matrix adds a null matrix
  Suggestion: change the return value to null in the validation process
  Comments: this is a careless mistake on return value

Error 1:
  Method: multiplyWithScalar()
  Test Method: test multiplyWithScalar()
  Message: multiplyWithScalar() did not return the correct values after the calculation
  Suggestion: check the logic in the calculation process carefully
  Comments: there is something wrong in the addition process

Error 2:
  Method: multiplyWithMatrix() 
  Test Method: test multiplyWithMatrix() 
  Message: multiplyWithMatrix() did not return the correct values after the calculation
  Suggestion: check the logic in the calculation process carefully
  Comments: this is a very strange case, when I print out the value I got from the program, it seemed to match the expected output, but the unit test failed and reported a mismatch, my assumption is the way java deals with doubles, this might be a case like "3.0 not equal to 3.0" in java, if that's the case it could be resolved by using a epsilon value.
