*********** ADD AS MANY MORE AS NEEDED *******************

ANALYSIS:

1. Compute how long it took you to complete all the bug fixes and the average time per bug fix.

Total time: 50 minutes
Number of bugs: 11
Average time per bug fix: 4.5 minutes

2. What was the hardest bug you fixed and what made it hard to fix?
    Defect 2 in the getElem() method, first we thought there is something wrong with the input, but I realized that I did
not read the method description carefully, so we read it again then we found out the input index is not the actual index
we should use in side the 2d array, which input index begins at 1 while in the array it starts at 0. So the index in the
array should be subtracted by 1 from the input index. My careless and the changed of mindset caused this delay in fix.

3. How consistent was your time to fix each bug? What factors may have affected that consistency?
    Pretty consistent, we find errors fast and fix them fast. But sometimes I am careless and didn't notice what's
described in the method introduction, then it would take me a long time to figure out why the error happened.
