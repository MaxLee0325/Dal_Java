Defect 1.
  Location: Workshop.java line 41
  Description: MakerElf should have the number of makers
  Fix: change numBuilders in the loop condition with numMakers

Defect 2.
  Location: Workshop.java line 41
  Description: BuilderElf should have the number of builders
  Fix: change numMakers in the loop condition with numBuilders

Defect 3.
  Location: Workshop.java line 94
  Description: Every time a toy is made, the material is not reduced
  Fix: change peek() into remove() to actually remove the material

Defect 4.
  Location: BuilderElf.java line 14
  Description: The energy is supposed to be 2
  Fix: change 3 into 2

Defect 5.
  Location: BuilderElf.java line 39
  Description: The energy should be added to all the elves
  Fix: delete the if statement

Defect 6.
  Location: MakerElf.java line 38
  Description: The energy should be added to all the elves
  Fix: delete the if statement

Defect 7.
  Location: BuilderElfTest
  Description: There is no unit test to test the elf with positive energy
  Fix: add a new unit test cookieBreakWithEnergy() to test the energy addition

Defect 8.
  Location: CookieElfTest
  Description: There is no unit test to test the elf with positive energy
  Fix: add a new unit test cookieBreakWithEnergy() to test the energy addition

| Question 3 |
==============

Assertion 1.
  Location: Workshop.java line 40
  Description: Assert the input numbers should be positive

Exception 1.
  Location: BuilderElf.java line 76
  Exception thrown: InputMismatchException("The energy is invalid!!")
  Throw conditions: When the energy level is less than 1

Exception 2.
  Location: MakerElf.java line 48
  Exception thrown: InputMismatchException("Invalid energy!!")
  Throw conditions: When the energy level is less than 1

Exception 3.
  Location: MakerElf.java line 64
  Exception thrown: InputMismatchException("Invalid energy level!")
  Throw conditions: When the energy level is less than 2

Exception 4.
  Location: MakerElf.java line 26
  Exception thrown: InputMismatchException("Energy can't be negative!")
  Throw conditions: When the input energy level is negative

| Question 4 |
==============

Refactoring 1.
  Location: Workshop.java line 66
  Code smell: bad variable name b (data level)
  Proposed fix: change the name to meaningful: "needRest"

Refactoring 2.
  Location: Workshop.java line 67, 71
  Code smell: inefficient for loop to iterate through (statement level)
  Proposed fix: change indexed for loop to enhanced for loop

Refactoring 3.
  Location: Workshop.java line 66-78
  Code smell: finding out if needed rest could be extracted into a method (routine level)
  Proposed fix: extracted into a new method checkRest()


==============
| Question 5 |
==============

Class Refactoring 1.
  Class(es) involved: Workshop.java
  Location: line 26-30
  Issue identified: Encapsulate exposed member variables
  SOLID violation: Dependency Inversion Principle
  Proposed fix: change public into private

Class Refactoring 2.
  Class(es) involved: BuilderElf.java and MakerElf.java
  Location: N/A
  Issue identified: classes with similar behaviors can extend a superclass
  SOLID violation: Open/close principle
  Proposed fix: create a super class Elf

Class Refactoring 3.
  Class(es) involved: Workshop.java
  Location: line 131
  Issue identified: helper method only accessed in this class
  SOLID violation: Dependency Inversion Principle
  Proposed fix: change public into private

Class Refactoring 4.
  Class(es) involved: BuilderElf.java, MakerElf.java, Elf.java
  Location: method getEnergy()
  Issue identified: same action can be moved up to super class
  SOLID violation: Single Responsibility Principle
  Proposed fix: extract the method getEnergy() and move to superclass
