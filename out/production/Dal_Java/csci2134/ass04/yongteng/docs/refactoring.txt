Project: csci2134 assignment 4

1. Create a superclass "Walker"
   It is the parent class of the three children walker classes,
   it contains common methods and instance variables

2. Create a subclass "SpiralWalker"
   It is the walker object that walks in a spiral shape, it's
   path should be determined by the number of steps only

3. Create a subclass "BreadCrumbWalker"
   It is the walker object that walks forward like a random
   walker, but additionally it also walks back right after

4. Extract the common instance variables into the superclass

5. Create different constructors in the superclass, for different
   walkers to invoke.

6. Extract common methods from the subclass to superclass,
   including: saveWalkToFile(), saveWalkToDat(), getStepDirection(),
   some all methods are not extracted because they behave differently
   in that subclass

7. Create a generic method walk() in superclass, it's for generic
   purpose, will be override by subclasses

8. Specialized helper methods getMap(), getList() should be private and only exist in that
   SpiralWalker subclass

9. walk() method is specialized in each subclass as they walk differently,
   so each subclass has their own walk() method
